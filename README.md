Meteor-session-bind
===================

Two way data bindings between Meteor session variables and handlebars template html forms. 

Updated for Meteor 1.0!

#### Install

```
meteor add nikhizzle:session-bind 
```

## Basic Usage
In your javascript just add the following to the target template:
```js
sessionBind(Template.hello);
```

And then in your handlebars template to bind a form element to the session variable ```seshVar```:
```handlebars
<input type="text" {{bindSession "seshVar"}}>
```

The helper generates an id and keeps the value up to date, so you should not set either on your element. To set a default value on the input just do the following before template rendering:
```js
Session.set("seshVar", "default text")
```

The helper has been tested with input tags (range, text, checkbox, and number), as well as select and textarea tags. It does not work with radio buttons (file an issue if that is something you need). 

See examples in the test file [here](https://github.com/nikhilbobb/Meteor-session-bind/blob/master/session-bind_tests.html).

## Advanced Usage

If you want to keep your session namespace clean then you can bind to a session object instead of a variable:
```handlebars
<input type="text" {{bindSession "seshVar" "seshObj"}}>
```
Then to get back the var:
```js
var obj = Session.get("seshObj");
obj.seshVar; //is your variable
```
This is especially useful when you have multiple forms, as you can come up with an object per form.
